# Installation

## Basic 
You'll need to install the following software to make full use of these dotfiles.

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) (1.8+)
- [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (7.3+)

## Vim
All of the Vim plugins are managed using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), so you'll need to run `:PlugInstall` the first time you open Vim.

## Tmux
All of the Tmux plugins are managed using [tmux-fpp](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-fpp), so you'll need to press `prefix + I` to fetch the plugins the first time you open Tmux.
